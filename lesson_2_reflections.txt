What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A: Git begins tracking meta data for your first commit.  

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Staging area is phantom -- it's the elements in the actual working directory (folder on a harddrive) that will be added to a commit. 
A staging area allows only what is needed for the next commit to be commited.
